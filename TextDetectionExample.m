%% Automatically Detect and Recognize Text in Natural Images
% This example shows how to detect regions in an image that contain text.
% This is a common task performed on unstructured scenes. Unstructured
% scenes are images that contain undetermined or random scenarios. For
% example, you can detect and recognize text automatically from captured
% video to alert a driver about a road sign. This is different than
% structured scenes, which contain known scenarios where the position of
% text is known beforehand.
%
% Segmenting text from an unstructured scene greatly helps with additional
% tasks such as optical character recognition (OCR). The automated text
% detection algorithm in this example detects a large number of text region
% candidates and progressively removes those less likely to contain text.

%% Step 1: Detect Candidate Text Regions Using MSER
% The MSER feature detector works well for finding text regions [1]. It
% works well for text because the consistent color and high contrast of
% text leads to stable intensity profiles.
%
% Use the |detectMSERFeatures| function to find all the regions within the
% image and plot these results. Notice that there are many non-text regions
% detected alongside the text.

colorImage = imread('sample1.png');
I = rgb2gray(colorImage);

% Detect MSER regions.
[mserRegions] = detectMSERFeatures(I,'RegionAreaRange',[200 8000],'ThresholdDelta',2);

%% Step 4: Merge Text Regions For Final Detection Result
% At this point, all the detection results are composed of individual text
% characters. To use these results for recognition tasks, such as OCR, the
% individual text characters must be merged into words or text lines. This
% enables recognition of the actual words in an image, which carry more
% meaningful information than just the individual characters. For example,
% recognizing the string 'EXIT' vs. the set of individual characters
% {'X','E','T','I'}, where the meaning of the word is lost without the
% correct ordering.
%
% One approach for merging individual text regions into words or text lines
% is to first find neighboring text regions and then form a bounding box
% around these regions. To find neighboring regions, expand the bounding
% boxes computed earlier with |regionprops|. This makes the bounding boxes
% of neighboring text regions overlap such that text regions that are part
% of the same word or text line form a chain of overlapping bounding boxes.

% Get bounding boxes for all the regions
bboxes = vertcat(mserStats.BoundingBox);

% Convert from the [x y width height] bounding box format to the [xmin ymin
% xmax ymax] format for convenience.
xmin = bboxes(:,1);
ymin = bboxes(:,2);
xmax = xmin + bboxes(:,3) - 1;
ymax = ymin + bboxes(:,4) - 1;

% Expand the bounding boxes by a small amount.
expansionAmount = 0.02;
xmin = (1-expansionAmount) * xmin;
ymin = (1-expansionAmount) * ymin;
xmax = (1+expansionAmount) * xmax;
ymax = (1+expansionAmount) * ymax;

% Clip the bounding boxes to be within the image bounds
xmin = max(xmin, 1);
ymin = max(ymin, 1);
xmax = min(xmax, size(I,2));
ymax = min(ymax, size(I,1));

% Show the expanded bounding boxes
expandedBBoxes = [xmin ymin xmax-xmin+1 ymax-ymin+1];
IExpandedBBoxes = insertShape(colorImage,'Rectangle',expandedBBoxes,'LineWidth',3);

%%
% Now, the overlapping bounding boxes can be merged together to form a
% single bounding box around individual words or text lines. To do this,
% compute the overlap ratio between all bounding box pairs. This quantifies
% the distance between all pairs of text regions so that it is possible to
% find groups of neighboring text regions by looking for non-zero overlap
% ratios. Once the pair-wise overlap ratios are computed, use a |graph| to
% find all the text regions "connected" by a non-zero overlap ratio.
%
% Use the |bboxOverlapRatio| function to compute the pair-wise overlap
% ratios for all the expanded bounding boxes, then use |graph| to find all
% the connected regions.

% Compute the overlap ratio
overlapRatio = bboxOverlapRatio(expandedBBoxes, expandedBBoxes);

% Set the overlap ratio between a bounding box and itself to zero to
% simplify the graph representation.
n = size(overlapRatio,1); 
overlapRatio(1:n+1:n^2) = 0;

% Create the graph
g = graph(overlapRatio);

% Find the connected text regions within the graph
componentIndices = conncomp(g);

%%
% The output of |conncomp| are indices to the connected text regions to
% which each bounding box belongs. Use these indices to merge multiple
% neighboring bounding boxes into a single bounding box by computing the
% minimum and maximum of the individual bounding boxes that make up each
% connected component.

% Merge the boxes based on the minimum and maximum dimensions.
xmin = accumarray(componentIndices', xmin, [], @min);
ymin = accumarray(componentIndices', ymin, [], @min);
xmax = accumarray(componentIndices', xmax, [], @max);
ymax = accumarray(componentIndices', ymax, [], @max);

% Compose the merged bounding boxes using the [x y width height] format.
textBBoxes = [xmin ymin xmax-xmin+1 ymax-ymin+1];

%%
% Finally, before showing the final detection results, suppress false text
% detections by removing bounding boxes made up of just one text region.
% This removes isolated regions that are unlikely to be actual text given
% that text is usually found in groups (words and sentences).

% Remove bounding boxes that only contain one text region
%numRegionsInGroup = histcounts(componentIndices);
%textBBoxes(numRegionsInGroup == 1, :) = [];

% Show the final text detection result.
ITextRegion = insertShape(colorImage, 'Rectangle', textBBoxes,'LineWidth',3);

%% Step 5: Recognize Detected Text Using OCR
% After detecting the text regions, use the |ocr| function to recognize the
% text within each bounding box. Note that without first finding the text
% regions, the output of the |ocr| function would be considerably more
% noisy.

ocrtxt = ocr(I, textBBoxes);
[ocrtxt.Text]

%%
% This example showed you how to detect text in an image using the MSER
% feature detector to first find candidate text regions, and then it
% described how to use geometric measurements to remove all the non-text
% regions. This example code is a good starting point for developing more
% robust text detection algorithms. Note that without further enhancements
% this example can produce reasonable results for a variety of other
% images, for example, posters.jpg or licensePlates.jpg.
